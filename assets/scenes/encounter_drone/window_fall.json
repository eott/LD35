    "description": "Taking the chances, you bring all your weight down on the floor. It holds, but creaks and cracks in all places. You slowly turn around and tread to the stairs down, every step carefully measured.<br/><br/>As you are halway down to the next level you feel like the world is shifting every so slightly. No, you realize the construction is no longer level. The upper level was not secured to the building to begin with, the bolts having broken free from the concrete. A slight breeze is shaking the construction softly. You stop moving.<br/><br/>Then, after a few seconds of silence, you take another step and quickly realize your mistake. The bolts on the level near you suddenly snap free from the wall as well. Everything shakes and the fire exit groans with stress. Another snap and the lower-next level is broken free from the wall as well.<br/><br/>The fire exit is now tilting towards the ground and accelerating at that. A few seconds after that you feel light and hold on to the railings as the ground rushes up to meet the falling fire exit. A few flashes of red and black and the whole world turns around and there is a feeling of sharp pain quickly replaced by blackness. Then, nothing.<br/><br/>THE END",
