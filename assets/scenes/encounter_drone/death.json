    "description": "\"Thank you for complying with our requests. We have further questions.\"<br/><br/>The drone continues to ask you questions that all ask about the information on the ID. You answer all questions with yes, keeping up the charade.<br/><br/>After a while you begin to wonder why they're asking questions about things that they clearly already know, when you realize there is a second buzzing noise. You look around again and see another shape in the sky, much higher than the apartment building. The shape stops moving just as you spot it. You don't immediately recognize the shape. When you do, you wish you had sooner.<br/><br/>The Beholder drone in front of you plays another message:<br/><br/>\"Thank you for complying with our requests. We do not have further questions. Goodbye.\"<br/><br/>You faintly hear three beeps from the drone above. You see it hovering like frozen in the wind. Then, nothing.<br/><br/>THE END",
