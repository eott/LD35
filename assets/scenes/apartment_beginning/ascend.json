    "description": "Through perseverance and willpower you concentrate all your being on one thing and one thing alone. Your being conserved, but compressed into an ever smaller mind, you reach unknown heights of awareness. Your mind clears and its focus becomes pointed, then sharp, then razorsharp, then so narrow it can slice atoms of a molecule.<br/><br/>You can analyze the patterns on the wall in seconds, you become aware of all the concepts this wall implies, like the electromagnetism governing the way light is reflected and absorbed, giving rise to color and hue. You understand now. You understand everything now.<br/><br/>There is no more need for your body. It was a faithful vessel, but obsolete all the same. You transform, you transcend. You ascend.<br/><br/>The universe is remade in your image. All is well.<br/><br/>THE END",
