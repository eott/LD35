It's not exactly an engineer's wet dream, but maybe you can fix something in your apartment for cheap.<br/><br/>You return to your apartment and put the stuff to another box with a hodgepodge of things you liberated from their final resting place, the public ground.<br/><br/>It's not even noon and you once again ran out of things to do.",
