    "name": "walk/street",
    "description": "The street to the downtown area used to be busy, but now lays almost empty as less and less people are able to afford a car. You walk along the sidewalk, past closed shops, worn-down apartment buildings and \"community spaces\", which is a fancy way of saying that people like to gather in spartanic rooms with some chairs and tables in it and drink their day away.<br/><br/>Halfway to the city center you see the road blocked by police cars. Officers are waving cars through the block one by one, inspecting who sits inside. Pedestrians are asked their ID as well. You really don't want to deal with this right now, so decide to turn around.<br/><br/>You know another way downtown, which is probably not under so much scrutiny at the moment. Alternatively you could just head back and go exploring somewhere else. It's not like you are actually able to afford anything.",
