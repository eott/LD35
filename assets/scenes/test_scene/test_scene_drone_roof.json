    "description": "You decide to stay on the roof and wait how the situation develops. The enforcers hurry across the plaza to gain entry to the staircase. However one of them stays behind and speaks hurried into his phone. He makes big sweeping gestures, then hangs up and looks at you. You are not sure what he's waiting for, but suddenly hear a faint buzzing noise. Oh no! It couldn't be!<br><br>A few seconds later you see a black object rapidly approaching in the air. It's a Peacemaker drone, no doubt. You realise that the other enforcers on the staircase are blocking your only route of escape, but you'd rather deal with some thugs than the Buzzing Death. You lower yourself to a bay sticking out from the tower, but your feet fail to hold grasp. As you struggle to climb inside you hear the dreaded three beeps preceding a quick and final fate. Your life begins to flash before your eyes, but these thoughts are rudely interrupted by a bullet through your brain.<br><br>THE END",
