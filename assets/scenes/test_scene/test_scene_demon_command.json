    "description": "Afraid of being erased by a poor plot device, you stutter the first thing that comes to your mind:<br><br>\"I- I command you to stop, uhm, the demon known as Cookie.\"<br><br>For some bizarre and unknowable reason, that seemed to work. The demon stares at you, but you continue to exist. Amazing that you got it on the first try. This is so incredible, you wonder if this is dream or a piece of badly written fiction. But soon you decide to fuck it. Not the demon, the story. You stop believing in all this nonsense and teleport to some south sea beach, where attractive persons of your choice serve you beverages of your choice and nothing else matters.<br><br>THE END",
