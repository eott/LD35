    "description": "You climb inside, which takes a while due to unforgiving angles and your lack of notable upper body strength. After you managed to do it anyway, you can already hear the enforcers entering the staircase. Rats, you shouldn't have waited so long. There is no other escape route and you can't fight the entire group. Your only way out alive is to let them rough you up a bit, then let a judge rule your fate. You wait in the steeple until the group enters the room.<br><br>As you lie on the floor, punches and kicks rolling over you, you muse that whatever happened in the last few hours better be worth it, but at least you're still alive.<br><br>THE END",
