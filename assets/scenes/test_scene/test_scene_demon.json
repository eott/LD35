It stinks like blood and looks like blood and you didn't know humans even had that much blood.<br><br>In the smack middle of it stands a huge, horned demon chewing on some body part or another. The demon turns around to face you and you realise it's the Demon of Unfinished Stories. There is no escape, you know you will simply cease to exist when he looks at you.",
